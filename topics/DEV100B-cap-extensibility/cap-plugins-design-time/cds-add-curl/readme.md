# cds-add-curl

This is a plugin for the Node.js flavor of SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) and was demoed as part of the [Developer keynote [deconstructed]](https://www.sap.com/events/teched/virtual/flow/sap/te24/catalog/page/catalog/session/1723584532995001g7Xm) at SAP TechEd 2024. It's purpose is to add a `curl` facet to the `cds add` command that comes with the [@sap/cds-dk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/cds-dk). In result, the command `cds add curl` will add sample curl scripts to the CAP project that allow to test the service endpoints of the application.
